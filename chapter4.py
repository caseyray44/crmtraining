            "Hey, sales rockstar! You’ve mastered creating customers, chasing leads, and sending estimates. Now, let’s talk about the best part: making money! This chapter is all about how commissions work in Markate so you can fill your wallet with every deal you close.\n\n"

            "We’re laying out the simple rules of commissions. Get these down, and you’ll know exactly how to earn your share!\n\n"
            "**The big rules:**\n"
            "- You must create and send the estimate yourself to get any commission. If someone else does it, they get the cash—not you!\n"
            "- **New customers:** You earn 10% of the estimate total (before taxes) when it’s accepted. Markate tracks this automatically.\n"
            "- **Existing customers:** You earn 5% for upselling them, but you’ll need to submit a special form (don’t worry, we’ll show you how).\n"
            "- Your commissions go to payroll, so you’ll see them in your paycheck. If you’re ever curious, check with the office manager.\n\n"
            "**Real-life example:**\n"
            "Sarah sends a $600 estimate to a new customer, and they say yes—boom, she earns $60 (10%)! Later, she convinces an old customer to spend $600 on another service, earning $30 (5%). Knowing the difference helps her plan her day!\n\n"

            "**Steps to earn 10% commissions:**\n"

            "3. **Call them up:** Chat with the lead, get to know their needs, and schedule a meeting (move them to 'Scheduled').\n"
            "4. **Send your estimate:** Go to 'Sales' > 'Estimates,' click '+ New Estimate,' fill it out (like in Chapter 3), and hit 'Submit.' Make sure you’re the one sending it!\n"
            "5. **Wait for the win:** When the customer accepts, Markate turns the lead into a customer and creates a work order. Your 10% commission is automatically sent to payroll.\n\n"
            "**Checking your commission:**\n"
            "You don’t have access to fancy reports, but no stress—your commissions are tracked by the office and show up in your paycheck. If you’re curious, just ask the office manager, and they’ll confirm what’s been logged.\n\n"
            "**Real-life example:**\n"
            "Jake spots a new lead, Mike, in 'Assigned.' He calls, sets up a meeting, and sends a $400 estimate for pest control. Mike accepts, and Jake’s $40 commission (10%) is tracked for his next paycheck. He checks with the office manager to confirm—smooth sailing!\n\n"

            "**What’s this module about?**\n"
            "Upselling means convincing past customers to buy again—like repeating last year’s window washing. The trick is following the right steps to lock in your 5% commission.\n\n"

            "1. **Call the customer:** Find someone who’s bought before. Go to 'Sales' > 'Customers,' type their name (e.g., 'Mary Smith'), and check their contact info.\n"
            "2. **Review their old invoice:** Click their name, then 'Invoices,' to see what they paid for last time (e.g., $500 for gutter cleaning).\n"
            "3. **Confirm what they want:** Ask if they want the same service or something new. Say, 'Mary, want to do the $500 gutter cleaning again this year?' Get their okay.\n"
            "4. **Convert to work order:** On the invoice page, click 'More' (top right) > 'Convert to Work Order.'\n"
            "5. **Keep approved line items:** In the work order, only keep the services they agreed to (e.g., delete pest control if they only want gutters). Make sure the price matches (e.g., $500).\n"
            "6. **Fill out a work order sheet:** Grab a work order sheet (paper ones are on the office clipboard, or use the digital form on your tablet). Write down:\n"
            "   - Customer name (e.g., Mary Smith)\n"
            "   - Service (e.g., Gutter Cleaning)\n"
            "   - Price before taxes (e.g., $500)\n"
            "   - Your name as the rep\n"
            "7. **Turn it in:** Drop the sheet in the payroll bin—it’s the blue box by the office manager’s desk, right next to the coffee machine. Do this by Friday so your 5% commission gets tracked.\n\n"
            "**Why this matters:**\n"
            "This process tells payroll you earned 5% for the upsell, not the 10% for new customers. Skipping steps or messing up the sheet could mean no commission, so let’s get it right!\n\n"
            "**Real-life example:**\n"
            "Lisa calls Tom, an old customer who got $600 window washing last year. He agrees to do it again. Lisa finds his invoice, converts it to a work order, keeps only the window washing line item, and fills out a work order sheet for $600. She drops it in the payroll bin, earning $30 (5%). High five, Lisa!\n\n"
