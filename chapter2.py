**Welcome to Chapter 2: Leads Training!**  
Great job completing Chapter 1—you’ve learned how to create customer accounts in Markate, which is a huge part of your job at CC Inc. Now, we’re moving on to Chapter 2, where you’ll learn about *leads*. Leads are a big part of how CC Inc. finds new customers, and Markate helps us manage them. Don’t worry if you’ve never heard of leads before—I’ll explain everything step-by-step, just like in Chapter 1. Let’s get started!

**What is a Lead?**  
A lead is anyone who has shown interest in CC Inc.’s services. Think of a lead as someone raising their hand and saying, “I might want to buy something from you!” Here are some examples of leads:  
- **A New Customer**: Someone who calls and says, “I need a quote for house washing.” They’re not a customer yet, but they’re interested in our services.  
- **An Existing Customer**: A customer you already created in Chapter 1 (like John Doe) who calls and says, “I want to add holiday lights to my house.” They’re already a customer, but they’re a lead for a new service.  
- **A Quick Meeting**: Someone who says, “I’d like to meet with a sales rep to talk about pest control.” They’re not ready to buy yet, but they’re interested enough to talk.

At CC Inc., every lead starts in a special category called “Leads” in Markate. We don’t make them a customer right away—instead, we move them through different stages to turn them into a customer. This process is called *managing leads*, and it’s a big part of your job as a sales rep.

**Why Are Leads Important at CC Inc.?**  
Leads are like the seeds of our business—they’re the starting point for finding new customers and growing our company. Here’s why leads matter:  
- **They Bring in New Business**: Every new customer starts as a lead. For example, if someone calls and says, “I need my windows washed,” that’s a lead, and if you turn them into a customer, CC Inc. gets a new job!  
- **They Help Existing Customers**: Leads aren’t just new people—they can also be existing customers who want more services. For example, if John Doe already had house washing but now wants pest control, that’s a lead for a new service, which means more business for CC Inc.  
- **They Keep Our Pipeline Full**: At CC Inc., we want to always have new leads coming in, so there’s always work for our service teams. If we don’t have leads, we won’t have new customers, and our business won’t grow.

**How Do We Manage Leads in Markate?**  
Markate has a special section called “Leads” where we keep track of all our leads. It’s like a to-do list for people who are interested in our services. In Markate, leads move through different stages as we work with them. We’ll learn about these stages in detail in Module 3, but here’s a quick overview:  
- **New**: This is where all leads start. It’s like a “new leads” bucket that we want to keep full.  
- **Assigned**: When a lead needs a sales rep (like you!) to follow up, we move them here.  
- **Attempted to Contact**: If we try to reach the lead but can’t, we move them here and add notes.  
- **Scheduled**: If we schedule a meeting with the lead, they move here.  
- **Estimation / Waiting for Response**: After we send a quote (an estimate), the lead moves here while they decide.  
- **First Follow-Up**: If they don’t decide right away, we follow up and move them here.  
- **Second Follow-Up**: If they still don’t decide, we follow up one more time and move them here.

By the end of this process, a lead either becomes a customer (yay!) or decides not to buy (and we keep their info for later). Markate helps us manage this process by keeping all our leads organized and showing us what stage they’re in.

- **How Does This Fit into Your Role at CC Inc.?**  
  As a sales rep at CC Inc., your job is to find new customers and keep existing ones happy, and leads are a big part of that. You’ll be responsible for:  
  - **Finding New Leads**: It’s everyone’s job at CC Inc. to bring in new leads, whether it’s through phone calls, website inquiries, referrals, or repeat customers asking for new services. For example, if you meet someone at a community event who says, “I might need my house washed,” you’ll add them as a new lead in Markate.  
  - **Following Up on Leads**: You’ll contact leads to see if they’re ready to become customers. For example, if a lead says, “I need a quote for pest control,” you’ll schedule a meeting, send them a quote, and follow up to see if they’re ready to book the service.  
  - **Turning Leads into Customers**: Your goal is to move leads through the stages (which we’ll learn about in Module 3) until they become customers. For example, if a lead agrees to a house washing job, you’ll create a customer account for them in Markate (like you learned in Chapter 1) and schedule the service.  
  - **Keeping Leads Moving**: You’ll make sure leads don’t get stuck in one stage for too long. For example, if a lead hasn’t responded to a quote, you’ll follow up to keep the conversation going. This ensures CC Inc. doesn’t miss out on potential business.

By managing leads in Markate, you’re helping CC Inc. grow its customer base and keep our service teams busy. It’s a key part of your role, and Markate makes it easier by keeping everything organized in one place.

**What’s Next?**  
In the next module, we’ll learn how to view leads in Markate using two different views: Pipeline View and Table View. This will help you see where each lead is in the process and decide what to do next. To make sure you understand what leads are, I’ve prepared a reflection task for you. Let’s do this!

**Let’s Learn How to View Leads in Markate!**  
Now that you understand what leads are and why they’re important, it’s time to learn how to view them in Markate. Markate gives us two different ways to look at our leads: *Pipeline View* and *Table View*. Each view has its own benefits, and you’ll use both as a sales rep at CC Inc. I’ll explain how to access these views, what they show, and how to use them to manage your leads. Let’s get started!

**What You’ll Do in This Module**  
You’ll learn how to find the Leads section in Markate and explore the two ways to view leads: Pipeline View and Table View. You’ll also think about which view you might prefer for your work as a sales rep. This will help you get comfortable with seeing and organizing leads in Markate, so you can start managing them effectively.

**How to Find the Leads Section in Markate**  
Let’s start by navigating to the Leads section in Markate. Follow these steps carefully:  
1. **Make Sure You’re on the Markate Dashboard**: You should already be logged into Markate’s staging environment (https://stg.markate.com/, Username: Markate, Password: crm4you, then Email: support@xecutetech.com, Password: Windows4). If you’re not, go back to Chapter 1, Module 2, and follow the login steps. You’ll know you’re on the dashboard because you’ll see a menu bar at the top with options like “Sales,” “Leads,” and “Customers.”  
2. **Find the “Sales” Tab**: Look at the top of the screen. You’ll see a menu with options like “Sales,” “Leads,” “Schedule,” and more. Find the one that says “Sales.” You used this in Chapter 1 to get to the Customers page—it’s usually one of the first options on the left.  
3. **Hover Over the “Sales” Tab**: Move your mouse cursor over the word “Sales” (don’t click yet!). A dropdown menu will appear with more options, just like when you found the Customers page.  
4. **Click on “Leads”**: In the dropdown menu, find the option that says “Leads” and click on it.  
   - **What If I Don’t See “Leads”?** If you don’t see “Leads” in the dropdown menu, make sure you’re hovering over “Sales” and not another tab like “Customers.” If you still don’t see it, try refreshing the page by pressing F5 on your keyboard, or log out and log back in.  
5. **Welcome to the Leads Section!**: After clicking “Leads,” you’ll be taken to the Leads section in Markate. This is where you’ll see all the leads we’re working with at CC Inc. (in the staging environment, these will be fake leads for practice). It’s like a to-do list of people who are interested in our services, and you’ll use this section to manage them.

**Understanding Pipeline View**  
When you first get to the Leads section, you’ll see the *Pipeline View* by default. Here’s what it looks like and how it works:  
- **What It Looks Like**: Pipeline View shows your leads in columns, with each column representing a stage in the process (like “New,” “Assigned,” “Scheduled,” etc.). It’s like a big board with sticky notes—each lead is a sticky note, and you can move it from one column to another as you work with them.  
- **How It Works**: Each lead is displayed as a card with basic info, like the lead’s name and what they’re interested in (e.g., “John Doe - House Washing”). You can drag and drop the card to move it from one stage to another. For example, if you schedule a meeting with John Doe, you can drag his card from “New” to “Scheduled.”  
- **Why It’s Useful**: Pipeline View is great for seeing the big picture—it shows you where all your leads are in the process at a glance. For example, you can quickly see how many leads are in the “New” stage (waiting for you to contact them) or how many are in “Waiting for Response” (waiting for the customer to decide). It’s like a visual map of your work, which helps you stay organized and prioritize what to do next.

**Understanding Table View**  
Markate also gives you another way to view leads: *Table View*. Here’s how to switch to it and what it shows:  
- **How to Switch to Table View**: On the Leads page, look for a button or icon near the top that says “Table View” or looks like a grid (it might be next to “Pipeline View”). Click on it to switch from Pipeline View to Table View.  
  - **What If I Can’t Find It?** If you don’t see a “Table View” button, look for a small icon that looks like a table (rows and columns) or a toggle switch. If you still can’t find it, try refreshing the page or ask for help—we’ll make sure you can access it!  
- **What It Looks Like**: Table View shows your leads in a list, like a spreadsheet. Each lead is a row, and there are columns for different details, like the lead’s name, contact info, stage, and more. For example, you might see a row for “John Doe” with columns showing his email, phone number, and current stage (“New”).  
- **How It Works**: You can sort and filter the list to find specific leads. For example, you can sort by stage to see all the “New” leads at the top, or filter to show only leads that are “Waiting for Response.” You can also click on a lead to see more details, like any notes you’ve added.  
- **Why It’s Useful**: Table View is great for digging into details—it lets you sort and filter to find exactly what you’re looking for. For example, if you want to see all the leads that are “Waiting for Response” so you can follow up, Table View makes it easy to filter and find them. It’s like having a searchable list, which helps you focus on specific tasks.

**Pipeline View vs. Table View: Which Should You Use?**  
Both views are useful, and you’ll probably use them both depending on what you’re doing:  
- **Use Pipeline View When**: You want to see the big picture and move leads between stages. For example, if you’re planning your day and want to see how many leads are in each stage, Pipeline View is perfect. It’s also great for dragging leads to a new stage after you take action, like moving a lead from “New” to “Scheduled” after setting up a meeting.  
- **Use Table View When**: You need to find specific leads or sort them in a certain way. For example, if you want to see all the leads that are “Waiting for Response” so you can follow up, Table View makes it easy to filter and find them. It’s also helpful for seeing detailed info, like a lead’s phone number or notes, without having to click into each lead.

As you get more comfortable with Markate, you’ll figure out which view you prefer for different tasks. Some sales reps like Pipeline View for planning their day, while others prefer Table View for digging into details. You can switch between them anytime, so feel free to experiment!

**Why This Matters for You**  
- **Stay Organized**: Both Pipeline View and Table View help you keep track of your leads, so you always know what to do next. For example, Pipeline View shows you how many leads are waiting for you to contact them, while Table View lets you filter for leads that need a follow-up.  
- **Work Efficiently**: Knowing how to use both views lets you work faster and smarter. For example, if you need to call all the leads in the “New” stage, you can use Table View to sort them and get their phone numbers quickly.  
- **Understand the Process**: Seeing leads in different stages (like “New” or “Scheduled”) helps you understand the process of turning a lead into a customer. This will make you better at managing leads and closing deals.

**How This Fits into Your Role at CC Inc.**  
As a sales rep, you’ll spend a lot of time in the Leads section of Markate, and knowing how to view your leads is the first step to managing them. Pipeline View and Table View are tools to help you:  
- **See What’s Happening**: You’ll use these views to see where each lead is in the process, so you know what to do next. For example, if you see a lead in “New,” you’ll know to contact them. If you see a lead in “Waiting for Response,” you’ll know to follow up.  
- **Prioritize Your Work**: With Pipeline View, you can quickly see which stages have the most leads, so you can focus on what’s most important. For example, if the “New” stage is full, you’ll know to spend your day contacting those leads.  
- **Find Information Fast**: With Table View, you can sort and filter to find specific leads, which saves you time. For example, if you need to call all the leads who are waiting for a response, you can filter the list and get their phone numbers in seconds.

**What’s Next?**  
In the next module, we’ll dive deeper into the 7 stages of managing leads at CC Inc. You’ll learn what each stage means and how to move leads through them, so you can turn them into customers. To make sure you understand the difference between Pipeline View and Table View, I’ve prepared a reflection task for you. Let’s do this!

**Let’s Learn the 7 Stages of Managing Leads!**  
Now that you know how to view leads in Markate using Pipeline View and Table View, it’s time to learn the process we use to manage them at CC Inc. We move leads through 7 stages in Markate, from the moment they show interest to the moment they become a customer (or decide not to). I’ll explain each stage in detail, what you need to do, and why it’s important. Let’s dive in!

**What You’ll Do in This Module**  
You’ll learn about the 7 stages of managing leads at CC Inc., which you’ll see in Markate’s Pipeline View. You’ll understand what each stage means, what actions you need to take, and how to move leads from one stage to the next. This will help you turn leads into customers and keep CC Inc.’s business growing.

**The 7 Stages of Leads at CC Inc.**  
At CC Inc., we use a specific process to manage leads in Markate, moving them through 7 stages. Each stage represents a step in the journey from “interested” to “customer.” Here’s what each stage means, what you do, and why it matters:

1. **New**  
   - **What It Means**: This is where all leads start. A lead goes into the “New” stage as soon as they show interest in our services. They could come from a phone call (“I need a quote for house washing”), a website inquiry (“I filled out a form online”), a referral (“My friend told me about CC Inc.”), or a repeat customer asking for a new service (“I want pest control this time”).  
   - **What You Do**: Your job is to keep this bucket full—it’s everyone’s responsibility at CC Inc. to bring in new leads. For example, if you meet someone who says, “I might need my windows washed,” you’ll add them as a new lead in Markate (we’ll learn how in the next module). For now, just know that “New” is the starting point for every lead.  
   - **Why It Matters**: The “New” stage is like the fuel for our business—if we don’t have new leads coming in, we won’t have new customers. Keeping this bucket full ensures CC Inc. always has potential business to work on.

2. **Assigned**  
   - **What It Means**: This stage is for leads that need immediate attention from a sales rep (like you!). A lead moves to “Assigned” when someone at CC Inc. decides a sales rep needs to follow up.  
   - **What You Do**: As a sales rep, you’ll be assigned leads to contact. Your goal is to act quickly—within 24 hours. For example, if a lead says, “I need a quote for house washing,” you’ll call them to set up a meeting or send them a quote. Once you take action, you’ll move the lead to the next stage (like “Scheduled” or “Attempted to Contact”). This bucket should stay empty—assigned leads need to be handled fast!  
     - **Note**: If a lead is meant for someone else at CC Inc. (like Casey or another staff member, not a sales rep), it won’t be assigned to you. For example, if a lead needs an admin to handle paperwork, they’ll be assigned to the admin instead.  
   - **Why It Matters**: Acting quickly on assigned leads shows the customer we’re serious about helping them. If we wait too long, they might go to a competitor, and we’ll lose the business. Keeping this bucket empty ensures leads don’t sit around waiting.

3. **Attempted to Contact**  
   - **What It Means**: This stage is for leads you’ve tried to contact but couldn’t reach. For example, if you called a lead but they didn’t answer, or if there’s an issue (like a wrong number or they’re unavailable), you move them here.  
   - **What You Do**: When you move a lead to this stage, you *must* add notes in Markate to explain what happened. For example, you might write, “Called and left voicemail at 1:30 PM on 5/12/25.” This helps everyone at CC Inc. know what’s going on with the lead. You’ll also decide what to do next—maybe try calling again at a different time or send an email.  
   - **Why It Matters**: This stage helps you track leads that need extra effort to reach. For example, if you called at 1:30 PM and they didn’t answer, your note might remind you to try again in the evening when they’re more likely to be free. It keeps us organized and ensures no lead gets forgotten.

4. **Scheduled**  
   - **What It Means**: This stage is for leads you’ve successfully scheduled for a meeting or appointment. For example, if a lead says, “I’d like to meet to discuss pest control,” and you set up a meeting for next Tuesday, they move to “Scheduled.”  
   - **What You Do**: Once you schedule the meeting, Markate will automatically move the lead to this stage (you’ll learn how to do this in a later module). Your job is to prepare for the meeting—get ready to talk about CC Inc.’s services, answer their questions, and make a great impression. As we like to say at CC Inc., “Show up, shake hands, kiss babies, and do your thing!” This means being friendly, professional, and ready to help the customer.  
   - **Why It Matters**: Scheduling a meeting is a big step toward turning a lead into a customer—it means they’re serious enough to talk to you. A good meeting can convince them to choose CC Inc., so this stage is your chance to shine as a sales rep.

5. **Estimation / Waiting for Response**  
   - **What It Means**: This stage is for leads you’ve sent a quote (also called an estimate) to. For example, if a lead says, “I need a quote for house washing,” you’ll meet with them, figure out the cost, and send them the quote. Once you send the quote, Markate automatically moves the lead to this stage.  
   - **What You Do**: Your job is to wait for the customer to respond—they might say yes, no, or need more time to decide. Many leads will sit in this stage for a while as they think it over. You should check this bucket often (using Pipeline View or Table View) and follow up on quotes that haven’t been accepted yet. For example, if a lead hasn’t responded after a week, you might call them to see if they have any questions.  
   - **Why It Matters**: This stage is where leads decide whether to become customers. Following up shows the customer you care about their decision, which can make them more likely to say yes. If you don’t follow up, they might forget about the quote or choose a competitor.

6. **First Follow-Up**  
   - **What It Means**: This stage is for leads you’ve followed up with for the first time after sending a quote. For example, if a lead hasn’t responded to your quote after a week, you’ll call or email them to check in, and then move them to this stage.  
   - **What You Do**: When you follow up, you’ll ask if they’re ready to proceed with the service. For example, you might say, “Hi John, I wanted to check if you had any questions about the house washing quote I sent you. Are you ready to schedule the service?” Some customers might say yes, some might say no, and others might need more time. Add notes in Markate to keep track of what they say (e.g., “John said he needs another week to decide”). Your goal is to keep the conversation going.  
   - **Why It Matters**: Following up shows the customer you’re interested in helping them, which can make them more likely to choose CC Inc. Many customers need a little nudge to make a decision, and this stage ensures we don’t let leads slip away.

7. **Second Follow-Up**  
   - **What It Means**: This stage is for leads you’ve followed up with a second time after the first follow-up. If a lead is still undecided after your first follow-up, you’ll follow up again and move them here. This is the final follow-up before the lead either becomes a customer or decides not to buy.  
   - **What You Do**: Follow up one more time to see if the customer is ready to proceed. For example, you might say, “Hi John, I just wanted to check in one last time about the house washing quote. Are you ready to move forward, or do you have any other questions?” Add notes in Markate about their response (e.g., “John said he’s not interested right now but might need services later”).  
   - **Why It Matters**: This stage gives the customer one last chance to say yes, which can help us close more deals. It also ensures we don’t give up on leads too early—sometimes a second follow-up is all it takes to turn a lead into a customer.

**What Happens After the Second Follow-Up?**  
After the second follow-up, a lead will either become a customer or decide not to buy. Here’s what happens:  
- **If They Say Yes**: Great! You’ll create a customer account for them in Markate (like you learned in Chapter 1) and schedule the service. They’re no longer a lead—they’re now a customer.  
- **If They Say No**: We don’t delete leads, even if they say no. Instead, they stay in the “Second Follow-Up” stage, and we convert them into a customer account in Markate. This way, we have their information for future reference and can use it for marketing other services later. For example, if John says, “I don’t need house washing right now,” we’ll keep his info and might contact him later about pest control or holiday lights.  
  - **Note**: If a customer doesn’t want to receive marketing emails, they can opt out themselves. We don’t remove their info unless they specifically ask us to.  
- **Why Keep Their Info?** Even if a lead says no, they might change their mind later or need a different service. Keeping their info lets us reach out in the future, which can lead to more business for CC Inc.

**Final Notes on the 7 Stages**  
Here are some key things to remember as you manage leads through these stages:  
- **Every Lead Goes Through This Process**: Whether it’s a new customer or an existing one, every lead moves through these 7 stages. It’s a consistent process that helps us stay organized.  
- **Don’t Let Leads Get Stuck**: Your job is to keep leads moving through the stages—don’t let them sit in one stage for too long. For example, if a lead is in “Waiting for Response” for weeks, follow up to see if they’re ready to decide. If they’re in “Attempted to Contact,” try again at a different time. Keeping leads moving ensures we don’t miss out on potential business.  
- **Always Add Notes**: Whenever you move a lead to a new stage, add notes in Markate to explain what happened. For example, “Moved to Attempted to Contact—called and left voicemail at 1:30 PM on 5/12/25.” This keeps everyone at CC Inc. on the same page.  
- **Follow-Ups Are Key**: Many leads don’t say yes right away, but persistence can close deals. Following up shows the customer you care, which can make them more likely to choose CC Inc.  
- **Verify Who the Lead is Assigned To**: Make sure you know who’s responsible for each lead. For example, if a lead is assigned to you, act on it within 24 hours. If it’s assigned to someone else, make sure they know about it.

**Why This Matters for You**  
- **Turn Leads into Customers**: Understanding the 7 stages helps you know exactly what to do at each step, so you can turn more leads into customers. For example, following up at the right time can make the difference between a “yes” and a “no.”  
- **Stay Organized**: The stages keep your work structured, so you always know what’s next. For example, if a lead is in “Scheduled,” you know to prepare for a meeting. If they’re in “First Follow-Up,” you know to check in.  
- **Help CC Inc. Grow**: Every lead you turn into a customer means more business for CC Inc. By mastering this process, you’re helping our company succeed, which makes you a valuable part of the team.

**How This Fits into Your Role at CC Inc.**  
As a sales rep, managing leads through these 7 stages is a core part of your job. You’ll use this process to:  
- **Build Relationships**: Each stage is a chance to connect with the lead and show them why CC Inc. is the best choice. For example, a friendly follow-up call can make a lead feel valued and more likely to say yes.  
- **Close More Deals**: By following the stages, you’ll know when to follow up and how to keep the conversation going, which helps you turn more leads into customers. For example, a lead who’s been sitting in “Waiting for Response” might say yes after a well-timed follow-up.  
- **Keep Things Moving**: The stages ensure leads don’t get stuck or forgotten. For example, if a lead is in “Attempted to Contact,” you’ll know to try again, which keeps the process moving forward.

**What’s Next?**  
In the next module, we’ll learn how to create new leads in Markate, so you can start filling up that “New” bucket. You’ll practice adding 10 leads to get comfortable with the process. To make sure you understand how to create new leads, I’ve prepared a mini-quiz and a confirmation step to check that you’ve created all 10 leads. Let’s do this!

**Let’s Start Adding Leads to Markate!**  
Now that you understand the 7 stages of managing leads at CC Inc., it’s time to start adding leads to Markate. In this module, you’ll learn how to create a new lead in Markate’s staging environment, which is the first step in filling up that “New” bucket we talked about. We’ll practice by adding 10 leads, and I’ll walk you through every step to make sure you feel confident doing it.

**What You’ll Do in This Module**  
You’ll learn how to add a new lead to Markate by filling out a form with their details, like their name, contact info, and what they’re interested in. You’ll practice this by creating 10 leads in the staging environment, using fake information. This will help you get comfortable with the process, so you’re ready to add real leads later. At the end, I’ll have a mini-quiz to make sure you understand the steps, plus a confirmation step to check that you’ve created all 10 leads.

**What is a New Lead (Again)?**  
Just to recap from Module 1: a lead is anyone who has shown interest in CC Inc.’s services. A *new lead* is someone who has just shown that interest, and we’re adding them to Markate for the first time. For example:  
- **A Phone Call**: Someone calls and says, “I need a quote for window washing.” That’s a new lead.  
- **A Website Inquiry**: Someone fills out a form on our website saying, “I’m interested in pest control.” That’s a new lead.  
- **A Referral**: A friend of a customer says, “I heard you do great house washing—can you help me?” That’s a new lead.  
- **A Repeat Customer**: An existing customer (like John Doe from Chapter 1) says, “I want to add holiday lights.” That’s a new lead for a new service.

When you add a new lead to Markate, they automatically go into the “New” stage in the Pipeline View, ready for you to start working with them.

**How to Add a New Lead in Markate**  
Let’s add your first lead together. Follow these steps carefully, and I’ll explain why each step matters:  
1. **Go to the Leads Section**: Make sure you’re logged into Markate’s staging environment (https://stg.markate.com/, Username: Markate, Password: crm4you, then Email: support@xecutetech.com, Password: Windows4). Go to the Leads section (Sales → Leads), like you learned in Module 2. You should see the Pipeline View with columns like “New,” “Assigned,” etc.  
2. **Click the “New Lead” Button**: On the Leads page, look in the top right corner for a button that says “New Lead” (it might have a “+” symbol). Click on it to start adding a new lead.  
   - **What Does This Button Do?** Clicking “New Lead” opens a form where you’ll enter the lead’s information. It’s like opening a blank page in your to-do list to add a new task.  
3. **Fill in the Required Information**: Now you’ll enter the lead’s details. Since we’re in the staging environment, we’ll use fake information to practice. Here’s what to enter:  
   - **Lead Title**: This is a short name to identify the lead. Use a format like “Name - Service.” For example, “John Doe - Window Washing.” This makes it easy to see what the lead is about at a glance.  
     - **Example**: Lead Title: John Doe - Window Washing.  
   - **Customer Type**: Select “Residential” or “Commercial” from the dropdown menu. For this lead, let’s choose “Residential” since John Doe is an individual person.  
     - **Why This Field?** This tells Markate whether the lead is a person (Residential) or a business (Commercial), which helps us manage them correctly. We’ll practice with Commercial leads later.  
   - **Contact Name**: Enter the lead’s full name (e.g., John Doe). This is the person we’ll be communicating with.  
     - **Example**: Contact Name: John Doe.  
   - **Phone Number**: Use the format 555-XXXXXXX (e.g., 555-123-4567).  
     - **Why This Format?** Just like with customers in Chapter 1, we use 555-XXXXXXX for fake phone numbers in the staging environment to keep things consistent. In the real system, you’d use the lead’s actual phone number.  
   - **Email**: Use the format firstname@example.com (e.g., john@example.com).  
     - **Why This Format?** We use firstname@example.com for all fake emails in the staging environment, just like with customers. In the real system, you’d use the lead’s actual email.  
   - **Preferred Notification Method**: Select “Both Email & Text.”  
     - **Why Both?** This ensures the lead gets all important updates, like scheduling confirmations or quotes. It’s the same rule we used for customers in Chapter 1—it keeps them informed and reduces the chance of missed communication.  
   - **Billing Address**: Use a fake address (e.g., 123 Test Street, City, State, ZIP). For example, 123 Test Street, Springfield, IL, 62704.  
     - **Why This Field?** Just like with customers, the Billing Address is the same as the Service Address at CC Inc. since we don’t send paper bills. This is where we’ll provide services if the lead becomes a customer.  
   - **Lead Source (Optional)**: This field is for tracking where the lead came from (e.g., “Website” or “Referral”). For practice, you can leave it blank, or pick an option like “Phone Call.” In the real system, you’d fill this in if you know the source.  
   - **Lead Label**: Set this to “Hot,” “Warm,” or “Cold.” By default, all leads are set to “Hot.”  
     - **What Does This Mean?** The Lead Label shows how likely the lead is to become a customer:  
       - **Hot**: They’re very interested and likely to buy soon (e.g., “I need house washing next week!”).  
       - **Warm**: They’re interested but might need more time (e.g., “I’m thinking about pest control for next month.”).  
       - **Cold**: They’re not very interested right now (e.g., “I might need services someday, but not now.”).  
     - **Why Set It to Hot?** For practice, we’ll set all leads to “Hot” to keep things simple. In the real system, you’d choose the label based on how interested the lead seems.  
   - **Comments**: Add any extra notes about the lead (e.g., “Driveway splits left” or “Big dog on property”). For practice, let’s add a note like “Test lead - created for training.”  
     - **Why Add Comments?** This helps you and the team know any important details about the lead. For example, “Big dog on property” might tell the service team to be careful when they arrive.  
   - **Assign to Employee**: Choose who will handle the lead. For practice, assign it to yourself (e.g., “Damon” or “Jake,” depending on your username).  
     - **Why Assign It?** This tells everyone at CC Inc. who’s responsible for following up on the lead. In the real system, you might assign it to another sales rep or staff member, but for now, you’ll handle it yourself.  
4. **Click “Save” to Create the Lead**: Click the “Save” button at the bottom of the form. This adds the lead to Markate, and you’ll see it in the “New” column in Pipeline View (or as a new row in Table View).  
   - **What Happens When You Click Save?** The lead is now in Markate, and it’s ready for you to start working with. It will automatically appear in the “New” stage, waiting for you to take action (like contacting them).  
5. **Repeat This Process 10 Times**: To get comfortable with adding leads, you’ll create 10 new leads. Each time, use a different fake name, email, and address, but follow the same rules (firstname@example.com, 555-XXXXXXX, Both Email & Text, Lead Label: Hot). For example:  
   - Lead 1: John Doe - Window Washing, john@example.com, 555-123-4567, 123 Test Street, Springfield, IL, 62704.  
   - Lead 2: Sarah Smith - Pest Control, sarah@example.com, 555-234-5678, 456 Fake Avenue, Chicago, IL, 60601.  
   - Lead 3: Mike Johnson - Holiday Lights, mike@example.com, 555-345-6789, 789 Practice Road, Miami, FL, 33101.  
   And so on, until you’ve created 10 leads.  
   - **Why 10 Times?** Doing this 10 times helps you practice the process so it becomes second nature. By the time you’re done, you’ll be able to add a new lead quickly and confidently, which is a key part of your job as a sales rep.

**Why This Matters for You**  
- **Start the Process**: Adding new leads is the first step in turning them into customers. The more leads you add to the “New” bucket, the more opportunities you have to grow CC Inc.’s business.  
- **Practice Makes Perfect**: Creating 10 leads in the staging environment helps you get comfortable with the process, so you’re ready to add real leads later.  
- **Accuracy is Key**: Entering the right information (like the Lead Title and contact info) ensures you can follow up with the lead effectively. For example, a clear Lead Title like “John Doe - Window Washing” tells you exactly what the lead is about, so you can prepare for your follow-up.

**How This Fits into Your Role at CC Inc.**  
As a sales rep, one of your main jobs is to bring in new leads and add them to Markate. When someone calls and says, “I need a quote for house washing,” you’ll create a new lead with their details, so you can start working with them through the 7 stages. This ensures CC Inc. always has new potential customers to work with, which keeps our business growing. By practicing now, you’re getting ready to do this job well!

**What’s Next?**  
In the next module, we’ll learn how to create new opportunities in Markate, which are for existing customers who want a quote for an additional service. You’ll practice adding 10 opportunities to get comfortable with the process. To make sure you understand how to create new leads, I’ve prepared a mini-quiz and a confirmation step to check that you’ve created all 10 leads. Let’s do this!

**Let’s Learn About Opportunities in Markate!**  
You’ve done a great job adding new leads to Markate—now it’s time to learn about a related concept: *opportunities*. In this module, you’ll learn how to create a new opportunity in Markate’s staging environment, which is something you’ll do for existing customers who want a quote for an additional service. We’ll practice by adding 10 opportunities, and I’ll walk you through every step to make sure you feel confident.

**What You’ll Do in This Module**  
You’ll learn how to create a new opportunity in Markate for an existing customer who wants a quote for a new service. You’ll practice this by adding 10 opportunities in the staging environment, using fake information. This will help you get comfortable with the process, so you’re ready to create real opportunities later. At the end, I’ll have a scenario task to make sure you understand the difference between a new lead and a new opportunity.

**What is a New Opportunity?**  
A *new opportunity* is a request from an existing customer for a quote on an additional service that we haven’t priced for them before. Let’s break that down:  
- **Existing Customer**: This is someone who already has a customer account in Markate, like the ones you created in Chapter 1 (e.g., John Doe, who got house washing last year).  
- **Additional Service**: This is a new service they want that we haven’t quoted for them before. For example, if John Doe already had house washing but now wants pest control, that’s an additional service.  
- **Quote Needed**: We need to give them a price (a quote) for the new service, but only if we don’t already have a price in their account.

Here’s an example:  
- John Doe is an existing customer who had house washing last year. We already have a price for house washing in his account (e.g., $200). If he calls and says, “I want house washing again,” you don’t need to create a new opportunity—you can just look up the price in his account, confirm it with him, and schedule the service. (You might need to check the date of the estimate to make sure it’s still valid, as prices can change over time.)  
- But if John says, “I want pest control this time,” and we’ve never quoted pest control for him before, you’ll create a new opportunity to generate a quote for that service.

**Why Create a New Opportunity?**  
Creating a new opportunity helps us:  
- **Give Accurate Quotes**: It ensures we provide a new price for the additional service, tailored to the customer’s needs. For example, pest control might cost $150 for John’s house, and we need to calculate that price.  
- **Avoid Duplicates**: If we already have a price for a service in the customer’s account, we don’t create a new opportunity—we use the existing price. This prevents duplicate quotes and keeps the customer’s record clean and organized.  
- **Grow Business with Existing Customers**: Opportunities let us offer more services to customers we already work with, which means more business for CC Inc. For example, if John adds pest control, that’s extra revenue from a customer we already know.

**How to Create a New Opportunity in Markate**  
Let’s create a new opportunity together. We’ll use one of the customers you created in Chapter 1 (or your own test account) as the existing customer. Follow these steps carefully:  
1. **Go to the Leads Section**: Make sure you’re logged into Markate’s staging environment (https://stg.markate.com/, Username: Markate, Password: crm4you, then Email: support@xecutetech.com, Password: Windows4). Go to the Leads section (Sales → Leads).  
2. **Click the “New Opportunity” Button**: On the Leads page, look in the top right corner for a button that says “New Opportunity” (it might have a “+” symbol, similar to the “New Lead” button). Click on it to start creating a new opportunity.  
   - **What Does This Button Do?** Clicking “New Opportunity” opens a form where you’ll enter the details of the additional service the customer wants. It’s like adding a new task to your to-do list, but specifically for an existing customer.  
3. **Fill in the Required Information**: Now you’ll enter the details of the opportunity. Since we’re in the staging environment, we’ll use fake information to practice. Let’s pretend John Doe (from Chapter 1) wants a quote for pest control. Here’s what to enter:  
   - **Opportunity Title**: This is a short name for the service the customer wants. Use the name of the service, like “Pest Control” or “Gutter Cleaning.”  
     - **Example**: Opportunity Title: Pest Control.  
   - **Customer**: Select the existing customer from the dropdown list. Look for “John Doe” (or use your own test account if you prefer).  
     - **Why This Field?** Since this is an opportunity for an existing customer, we need to link it to their account in Markate. The dropdown list shows all the customers you’ve already created, like the ones from Chapter 1.  
   - **Job Location**: Choose the service address where the customer wants the new service. For John Doe, this might be “123 Test Street” (his Billing Address from Chapter 1). If he has multiple addresses (like a vacation home named “Lakehouse”), you’d choose the right one. For now, let’s use “123 Test Street.”  
     - **Why This Field?** This ensures we know where to provide the service if the customer agrees to the quote. For example, if John wants pest control at his vacation home, we need to know that’s “Lakehouse” at 456 Secondary Street.  
   - **Lead Source (Optional)**: This is the same as in the “New Lead” form—it’s for tracking where the lead came from (e.g., “Phone Call”). For practice, you can leave it blank or pick an option like “Customer Request.”  
   - **Lead Label**: Set this to “Hot,” “Warm,” or “Cold.” Just like with new leads, we’ll set it to “Hot” by default for practice.  
     - **Why Hot?** Since this is an existing customer asking for a new service, they’re likely interested and ready to buy, so “Hot” makes sense. In the real system, you’d choose based on how interested they seem.  
   - **Comments**: Add any internal notes about the opportunity (e.g., “Customer mentioned they have a big ant problem”). For practice, let’s add a note like “Test opportunity - created for training.”  
     - **Why Add Comments?** This helps you and the team know any important details about the opportunity. For example, “Big ant problem” might tell the service team to bring extra supplies.  
   - **Assign to Employee**: Choose who will handle the opportunity. For practice, assign it to yourself (e.g., “Damon” or “Jake”).  
     - **Why Assign It?** This tells everyone at CC Inc. who’s responsible for following up on the opportunity. In this case, you’ll handle it yourself.  
4. **Click “Save” to Create the Opportunity**: Click the “Save” button at the bottom of the form. This adds the opportunity to Markate, and it will appear in the “New” stage in Pipeline View (or as a new row in Table View).  
   - **What Happens When You Click Save?** The opportunity is now in Markate, linked to the customer’s account (John Doe). It’s ready for you to start working with, just like a new lead—it will go through the same 7 stages (New, Assigned, etc.) until John agrees to the quote or decides not to buy.  
5. **Repeat This Process 10 Times**: To get comfortable with creating opportunities, you’ll add 10 opportunities. Each time, use a different customer (from the ones you created in Chapter 1) and a different service, but follow the same rules (Lead Label: Hot). For example:  
   - Opportunity 1: John Doe, Pest Control, 123 Test Street.  
   - Opportunity 2: Sarah Smith, Gutter Cleaning, 456 Fake Avenue.  
   - Opportunity 3: Mike Johnson, Roof Treatment, 789 Practice Road.  
   And so on, until you’ve created 10 opportunities. Use the customers you created in Chapter 1, or mix in your own test account if you’d like.  
   - **Why 10 Times?** Doing this 10 times helps you practice the process so it becomes second nature. By the time you’re done, you’ll be ready to create opportunities for real customers who want additional services.

**Why This Matters for You**  
- **Grow Business with Existing Customers**: Opportunities let you offer more services to customers you already work with, which means more revenue for CC Inc. For example, if John Doe adds pest control, that’s extra business from a customer we already know.  
- **Practice Makes Perfect**: Creating 10 opportunities in the staging environment helps you get comfortable with the process, so you’re ready to do it with real customers later.  
- **Accuracy is Key**: Entering the right details (like the Opportunity Title and Job Location) ensures you can provide an accurate quote and schedule the service at the right place. For example, a clear title like “Pest Control” tells you exactly what the customer wants, so you can prepare the right quote.

**How This Fits into Your Role at CC Inc.**  
As a sales rep, you’ll often work with existing customers who want additional services, and creating opportunities is how you’ll handle those requests. When a customer like John Doe calls and says, “I want pest control,” you’ll create a new opportunity to generate a quote for that service, then move it through the 7 stages until he agrees (or not). This helps CC Inc. grow our business by offering more services to customers we already know, and it makes you a key part of keeping those customers happy.

**What’s Next?**  
In the next module, we’ll learn how to assign employees to leads and opportunities, and we’ll go over some final notes on managing leads. To make sure you understand the difference between a new lead and a new opportunity, I’ve prepared a scenario task for you. Let’s do this!

**Let’s Learn About Assigning Leads and Opportunities!**  
You’re almost done with Chapter 2—great work! You’ve learned how to view leads, understand the 7 stages, and create new leads and opportunities in Markate. In this module, we’ll cover how to assign leads and opportunities to employees (like yourself or other staff members) and go over some final notes on managing leads. This will help you wrap up the process of working with leads at CC Inc.

**What You’ll Do in This Module**  
You’ll learn how to assign a lead or opportunity to a specific employee in Markate, and you’ll understand why this doesn’t automatically move the lead to the “Assigned” stage. You’ll also get some final tips on managing leads effectively. At the end, I’ll have a reflection task to help you think about what you’ve learned.

**How to Assign Employees to Leads & Opportunities**  
When you create a lead or opportunity in Markate (like you did in Modules 4 and 5), you assign it to an employee to make sure someone is responsible for following up. Let’s go over how to do this and what it means:  
- **Where You Assign It**: When you fill out the form for a new lead or opportunity (in the “New Lead” or “New Opportunity” form), there’s a field called “Assign to Employee.” You saw this in Modules 4 and 5, where you assigned the lead or opportunity to yourself (e.g., “Damon” or “Jake”).  
  - **What It Looks Like**: This field is usually a dropdown menu with a list of employees at CC Inc. For example, you might see names like “Damon,” “Jake,” “Casey,” or “Admin.”  
  - **What You Do**: Choose the employee who will handle the lead or opportunity. For example, if you’re working on the lead yourself, you’d select your own name. If you know Casey should handle it (e.g., because it’s a special request), you’d select Casey.  
- **Important Note**: Even though you assign a lead or opportunity to an employee, it does *not* automatically move to the “Assigned” stage in Pipeline View.  
  - **Why Not?** Assigning an employee in the form just tells Markate who’s responsible—it doesn’t mean the lead is ready for immediate action yet. The “Assigned” stage is specifically for leads that need a sales rep to follow up right away (within 24 hours), as we learned in Module 3.  
  - **What You Do**: After assigning the lead or opportunity, you need to manually drag it to the “Assigned” column in Pipeline View if it needs immediate attention. For example, if you assign a lead to yourself and know you need to call them today, you’d drag the lead from “New” to “Assigned” in Pipeline View.  
  - **How to Drag It**: In Pipeline View, click and hold the lead’s card (e.g., “John Doe - Window Washing”), then drag it to the “Assigned” column and let go. This moves the lead to the “Assigned” stage, and now you (or whoever it’s assigned to) need to act on it within 24 hours.  
- **Why This Matters**: Assigning leads and opportunities ensures everyone at CC Inc. knows who’s responsible for each one. Manually moving them to “Assigned” keeps the Pipeline View accurate, so you can see which leads need immediate action. For example, if you see a lead in “Assigned,” you’ll know it’s urgent and needs your attention right away.

**Final Notes on Managing Leads**  
Before we move on, here are some final tips to help you manage leads effectively as a sales rep at CC Inc.:  
- **Every Lead Goes Through the Process**: Whether it’s a new lead or an opportunity for an existing customer, every lead moves through these 7 stages. It’s a consistent process that helps us stay organized.  
- **Don’t Let Leads Get Stuck**: Your job is to keep leads moving through the stages—don’t let them sit in one stage for too long. For example, if a lead is in “Waiting for Response” for weeks, follow up to see if they’re ready to decide. If they’re in “Attempted to Contact,” try again at a different time. Keeping leads moving ensures we don’t miss out on potential business.  
- **Always Add Notes**: Whenever you move a lead to a new stage or take any action (like calling them), add notes in Markate to explain what happened. For example, “Moved to Attempted to Contact—called and left voicemail at 1:30 PM on 5/12/25.” This keeps everyone at CC Inc. on the same page and helps you remember what you’ve done.  
- **Follow-Ups Are Key**: Many leads don’t say yes right away, but persistence can close deals. Following up shows the customer you care, which can make them more likely to choose CC Inc.  
- **Verify Who the Lead is Assigned To**: Always double-check who’s responsible for each lead. For example, if a lead is assigned to you, act on it within 24 hours. If it’s assigned to someone else (like Casey), make sure they know about it. This ensures no lead falls through the cracks.

**Why This Matters for You**  
- **Stay Organized**: Assigning leads and opportunities ensures everyone knows who’s responsible, which keeps the process running smoothly. For example, if a lead is assigned to you, you’ll know it’s your job to follow up, and you won’t waste time wondering who’s handling it.  
- **Keep the Pipeline Accurate**: Manually moving leads to the “Assigned” stage ensures the Pipeline View reflects what’s really happening. For example, if a lead is in “Assigned,” you’ll know it needs immediate action, which helps you prioritize your work.  
- **Close More Deals**: Following these tips (like adding notes and following up) helps you manage leads more effectively, which means more customers for CC Inc. For example, a well-timed follow-up can turn a “maybe” into a “yes.”

**How This Fits into Your Role at CC Inc.**  
As a sales rep, assigning leads and opportunities is a key part of your job—it ensures the right person is handling each lead, and it keeps the process organized. By following these final tips, you’ll:  
- **Work as a Team**: Assigning leads to the right employee (like yourself or Casey) ensures everyone at CC Inc. knows their responsibilities. For example, if a lead needs an admin to handle paperwork, you’ll assign it to the admin, so they can take care of it.  
- **Stay on Top of Your Work**: Moving leads to the “Assigned” stage and adding notes keeps you organized, so you always know what to do next. For example, if you see a lead in “Assigned,” you’ll know to call them right away.  
- **Turn Leads into Customers**: Following these tips helps you manage leads more effectively, which means more customers for CC Inc. For example, adding notes ensures you don’t forget important details, and following up can close more deals.

This is the final piece of the puzzle for managing leads—you’re almost ready to put it all together!

**What’s Next?**  
In the next module, you’ll do a final task: creating a test opportunity for yourself using the test account you made in Chapter 1. This will help you see the whole process from both the sales rep’s side and the customer’s side. To make sure you understand assigning leads and these final tips, I’ve prepared a reflection task for you. Let’s do this!

**Let’s Put It All Together: Create Your Own Test Opportunity!**  
You’ve made it to the final module of Chapter 2—amazing work! You’ve learned how to view leads, understand the 7 stages, create new leads, create opportunities, and assign them to employees. Now, let’s bring it all together with a final task: you’re going to create a test opportunity for yourself in Markate, using the test account you made in Chapter 1. This will help you see the whole process from both the sales rep’s side and the customer’s side. I’ll guide you through every step, as always!

**What You’ll Do in This Module**  
You’ll create a test opportunity for yourself in Markate’s staging environment, pretending you’re an existing customer asking for a new service. You’ll use the test account you created in Chapter 1 (e.g., “Damon Smith” or “Jake Smith”), assign the opportunity to yourself, and move it to the “Assigned” stage in Pipeline View. This will give you a complete picture of how leads and opportunities work, from start to finish. At the end, I’ll have a reflection task to help you think about what you’ve learned.

**Why Create a Test Opportunity for Yourself?**  
Creating a test opportunity for yourself is like playing both roles in a play—you’ll be the sales rep creating the opportunity, and the customer receiving it. Here’s why this is so helpful:  
- **See the Whole Process**: You’ll experience the entire process of creating an opportunity, assigning it, and moving it through the stages, which ties together everything you’ve learned in Chapter 2.  
- **Understand the Customer’s Side**: By using your own test account, you’ll see what it’s like to be a customer asking for a new service. This builds on what you learned in Chapter 1, Module 7, where you created your test account to see the customer’s perspective.  
- **Practice Makes Perfect**: This final task gives you one more chance to practice creating an opportunity, assigning it, and moving it in Pipeline View, so you’re fully prepared to do this with real customers.  
- **Build Confidence**: Seeing the whole process from start to finish makes you more confident as a sales rep. You’ll know exactly what to do when a real customer asks for a new service, and you’ll understand how your actions affect them.

**How to Create Your Test Opportunity in Markate**  
Let’s create your test opportunity together. We’ll pretend you’re an existing customer (using your test account from Chapter 1) asking for a new service, like gutter cleaning. Follow these steps carefully:  
1. **Go to the Leads Section**: Make sure you’re logged into Markate’s staging environment (https://stg.markate.com/, Username: Markate, Password: crm4you, then Email: support@xecutetech.com, Password: Windows4). Go to the Leads section (Sales → Leads).  
2. **Click the “New Opportunity” Button**: In the top right corner of the Leads page, click the “New Opportunity” button to start creating a new opportunity.  
3. **Fill in the Required Information**: Now you’ll enter the details of your test opportunity. Since this is for your test account, you’ll use your own name (or the name you used in Chapter 1). Here’s what to enter:  
   - **Opportunity Title**: Use the format “Test Opportunity - [Your Name].” For example, if your name is Damon, enter “Test Opportunity - Damon.”  
     - **Example**: Opportunity Title: Test Opportunity - Damon.  
   - **Customer**: Select your test account from the dropdown list. Look for your name (e.g., “Damon Smith” or “Jake Smith”)—this should be the account you created in Chapter 1, Module 7.  
     - **What If I Don’t See My Account?** If you don’t see your test account in the dropdown list, make sure you created it in Chapter 1, Module 7. If you didn’t, go back to that module and create it now, then come back here.  
   - **Job Location**: Choose the service address from your test account. In Chapter 1, you used a fake address like “123 Test Street, Springfield, IL, 62704.” Select that address.  
     - **Why This Field?** This ensures we know where to provide the service if you (as the customer) agree to the quote. For this test, we’ll use the address you entered in Chapter 1.  
   - **Lead Source (Optional)**: For practice, let’s set this to “Customer Request,” since you’re pretending to be a customer asking for a new service.  
   - **Lead Label**: Set this to “Hot,” just like we did in Module 5.  
     - **Why Hot?** Since this is a test opportunity, we’ll assume you’re very interested (as the customer), so “Hot” makes sense.  
   - **Comments**: Add a note like “Test opportunity created for training purposes.”  
     - **Why Add a Comment?** This helps us keep track of why this opportunity exists—it’s for your training, not a real customer request.  
   - **Assign to Employee**: Select yourself (e.g., “Damon” or “Jake”).  
     - **Why Assign It to Yourself?** Since this is a test, you’ll handle the opportunity yourself, so you can see the whole process from both sides.  
4. **Click “Save” to Create the Opportunity**: Click the “Save” button at the bottom of the form. This adds the opportunity to Markate, and it will appear in the “New” stage in Pipeline View.  
5. **Drag the Opportunity to the “Assigned” Stage**: In Pipeline View, find your test opportunity (e.g., “Test Opportunity - Damon”). Click and hold the card, then drag it from the “New” column to the “Assigned” column and let go.  
   - **Why Move It to Assigned?** This simulates what you’d do if the opportunity needed immediate action (like following up within 24 hours). It also lets you practice moving leads in Pipeline View, which you learned in Module 6.

**What Happens Next?**  
Now that you’ve created your test opportunity, let’s see what it looks like from both sides:  
- **As a Sales Rep**: You’ve created an opportunity for “Test Opportunity - Damon,” assigned it to yourself, and moved it to the “Assigned” stage. In a real scenario, you’d now follow up by preparing a quote for gutter cleaning and sending it to the customer (which would move the opportunity to “Estimation / Waiting for Response”). For this test, you can imagine what you’d do next: call the customer (yourself!), discuss the service, and send a quote.  
- **As a Customer**: You’re now the customer in this scenario, with an opportunity for gutter cleaning at “123 Test Street.” In a real scenario, you’d get notifications (emails and texts) about the quote and any scheduled services. For example, you might get a message saying, “Here’s your quote for gutter cleaning: $150.” In the staging environment, no real messages are sent, but you can imagine what it would be like to receive them.

**Why This Matters for You**  
- **See Both Sides**: Creating a test opportunity for yourself lets you see the process from both the sales rep’s side (creating and managing the opportunity) and the customer’s side (receiving the quote). This builds on what you learned in Chapter 1, Module 7, where you created your test account to see the customer’s perspective.  
- **Tie It All Together**: This task brings together everything you’ve learned in Chapter 2: creating opportunities, assigning them, and moving them through the stages. It’s like a final practice run before you start working with real leads and opportunities.  
- **Build Confidence**: Seeing the whole process from start to finish makes you more confident as a sales rep. You’ll know exactly what to do when a real customer asks for a new service, and you’ll understand how your actions affect them.

**How This Fits into Your Role at CC Inc.**  
As a sales rep, you’ll often create opportunities for existing customers who want additional services, and this task shows you how the whole process works. By creating a test opportunity for yourself, you’re practicing:  
- **Managing Opportunities**: You’ve created an opportunity, assigned it, and moved it to “Assigned,” which is exactly what you’ll do for real customers. For example, if a customer calls and says, “I want a quote for gutter cleaning,” you’ll know how to create the opportunity and start working with them.  
- **Understanding the Customer’s Experience**: Seeing the process from the customer’s side helps you empathize with them. For example, you’ll understand why notifications are important (because you’d want to get them as a customer), which makes you better at setting up opportunities for real customers.  
- **Closing the Loop**: This task completes the journey from creating a lead or opportunity to moving it through the stages, which is a core part of your job. It prepares you to turn real leads into customers, helping CC Inc. grow our business.

**What’s Next?**  
You’ve now completed all the modules for Chapter 2! You’ve learned how to manage leads in Markate, from creating them to moving them through the 7 stages, and you’ve even created a test opportunity for yourself. To finish Chapter 2, you’ll take a final quiz to test your understanding of everything we’ve covered. The quiz has 5 questions, and you need to get at least 4 correct (80%) to pass. If you don’t pass, you’ll need to review the modules and try again. I’ve prepared a reflection task to help you think about what you’ve learned in this module. Let’s do this!
